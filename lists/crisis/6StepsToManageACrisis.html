      <ul id="crisis">
        <li><b>1. Institute a communication hierarchy.</b>
          <br><img src="1.jpg">
          <br>Information wants to be free, and if the way information flows in your organization doesn't reflect this logical truth, you have a big problem on your hands.
          A smart communication hierarchy will bring you back in sync with the natural laws governing our world and get you one step closer to the crisis resolution you're after.
          </li>
        <li><b>2. Analyze the situation and carefully review all your options.</b>
          <br><img src="2.jpg">
          <br>You simply can't move forward until you're sure you have a comprehensive plan of attack. And you simply can't produce a comprehensive plan of attack if you haven't
          considered every "angle" on the situation. You know what you have to do.
          </li>
        <li><b>3. Publicize.</b>
          <br><img src="3.jpg">
          <br>Make your crisis public, and -- most importantly -- pay attention to what happens. Democracy works, and understanding public reaction to your crisis, however internal
          it may be, is critical to the development of your resolution plan.
          </li>
        <li><b>4. Establish a network of competing start-ups.</b>
          <br><img src="4.jpg">
          <br>You need to create a functioning marketplace of ideas. The meek will inherit the earth, insofar as their shitty proposals will be ground into the dust by superior men.
          If the crisis is that your start-up is failing to compete with better-adapted start-ups, you might want to consider skipping this step.
          </li>
        <li><b>5. Plant senior technology reporters on the ground.</b>
          <br><img src="5.jpg">
          <br>This crisis situation, and really every crisis situation, cannot be resolved without senior tech reporters who, with "boots on the ground," can investigate and
          report on the tech you're dealing with.
          </li>
        <li><b>6. Have fun.</b>
          <br><img src="6.jpg">
          <br>You may not get another chance to manage a crisis for a while. The most important thing is to enjoy yourself while you're doing it!
          </li>
        <li><b>Congratulations on resolving your crisis!</b>
